Privacy Policy
The Average Weight Tracker app does not collect any personal data from its users. The app runs locally on the user’s phone and does not have access to any functions outside of storing the inputs that the user gives it. Those inputs are stored locally and not accessible by anyone except the user or whomever the user lets control their phone.

The information is stored until the user decides to delete the app, whereupon all data will be deleted as well. The user thereby retains full control of the data provided to the app.
